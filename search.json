    "text": "As a wizard and scholar of Middle-earth, I have been studying the magic of the natural world for centuries. Through my self-portraits, I aim to capture the essence of my own being and reflect on my own journey through time. Each photograph is a reflection of my own experiences and emotions. Through my photography, I hope to offer a glimpse into my life as a scholar and adventurer, and inspire others to reflect on their own journeys through the world."

Born and raised in Alexandroupoli, Greece, having lived and worked for 2 years in Groningen, the Netherlands and since the 1st of April, 2023 my base is in Donostia-San Sebastian in the Basque Country, Spain.\nCurrently I am a PhD candidate in the Donostia International Physics Center (DIPC).\nIf I had to briefly describe my current situation, I would say that I am computational humanist currently working among physicists and chemists (the coolest thing I have ever done in my life; and the scariest)!\nMy research interests span from the implementation of Complex Networks to Cultural Analytics to study the emergence of relationships between humans and/or ideas to computational stylometry which tackles questions that are related to forensic linguistics. Anything related to Natural Language Processing (NLP) is always welcome.\nOn this website, you will find my work. You will also find news and updates on my current research projects, as well as information on upcoming events and conferences where I will be speaking. I invite you to explore my website and learn more about my life’s work and my research interests. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects and collaborations. I will be more than happy to reply, if I can!\n\nClick here to email me"
