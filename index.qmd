# Welcome to my website!

I am Paschalis Agapitos (Πασχάλης Αγαπητός)! Born and raised in [Alexandroupli, Greece](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Alexandroupoli+681+00,+Greece/@40.8491336,25.8547108,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x14b21c9f5c02c8d5:0xbab0f92b441e41e3!8m2!3d40.8457193!4d25.873962!16zL20vMDVzeWtw?entry=ttu), having lived and worked for 2 years in [Groningen, the Netherlands](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Groningen,+Netherlands/@53.2216766,6.4832935,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x47c83286b462cca7:0xcb4b5086f9a6c8dc!8m2!3d53.2193835!4d6.5665017!16zL20vMGQ4czg?entry=ttu) and since the 1st of April, 2023 my base is in [Donostia-San Sebastian in the Basque Country, Spain](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Donostia-San+Sebastian,+Gipuzkoa/@43.3072662,-2.0518221,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0xd51affe3b68fe15:0xe43ec55994864649!8m2!3d43.318334!4d-1.9812313!16zL20vMDJsNmw4?entry=ttu).

Currently I am a PhD candidate in the Donostia International Physics Center ([DIPC](https://dipc.ehu.eus/en)).

If I had to briefly describe my current situation, I would say that I am computational humanist currently working among physicists and chemists (the coolest thing I have ever done in my life; and the scariest)!

My research interests span from the implementation of Complex Networks to Cultural Analytics to study the emergence of relationships between humans and/or ideas to computational stylometry which tackles questions that are related to forensic linguistics. Anything related to Natural Language Processing (NLP) is always welcome.

On this website, you will find my work. You will also find news and updates on my current research projects, as well as information on upcoming events and conferences where I will be speaking. I invite you to explore my website and learn more about my life's work and my research interests.
Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:paschalis.agapitos@dipc.org) if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects and collaborations. I will be more than happy to reply, if I can!
